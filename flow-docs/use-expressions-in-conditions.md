# Use expressions in conditions to check multiple values
In this walkthrough, you'll learn to use expressions and **Conditions** to compare multiple values in **Advanced mode**.

When you create a flow, you can use the [**Condition**](add-condition.md#add-a-condition) card in basic mode to quickly compare a single value with another value. However, there're times when you need to compare multiple values. For example, you may want to check the value of a few columns in a spreadsheet or database table.

You can use any combination of the following logical expressions in your conditions.

Expression|Description|Example
--------|-----------|-------
|[and](#use-the-and-expression)|Takes two arguments and returns true if both values are true.<br><b>Note</b>: Both arguments must be Booleans.|This expression returns false: <br>and(greater(1,10),equals(0,0))
|[or](#use-the-or-expression)|Takes two arguments and returns true if either argument is true. <br><b>Note</b>: Both arguments must be Booleans.|This expression returns true:<br>or(greater(1,10),equals(0,0))
|equals|Returns true if two values are equal.|For example, if parameter1 is someValue, this expression returns true:<br>equals(parameters('parameter1'), 'someValue')
|[less](#use-the-less-expression)|Takes two arguments and returns true if the first argument is less than the second argument. <br><b>Note</b>: The supported types are integer, float, and string.|This expression returns true:<br>less(10,100)
|lessOrEquals|Takes two arguments and returns true if the first argument is less than or equal to the second argument. <br><b>Note</b>: The supported types are integer, float, and string.|This expression returns true:<br>lessOrEquals(10,10)
|[greater](#use-the-greater-expression)|Takes two arguments and returns true if the first argument is greater than the second argument. <br><b>Note</b>: The supported types are integer, float, and string.|This expression returns false:<br>greater(10,10)
|greaterOrEquals|Takes two arguments and returns true if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second argument. <br><b>Note</b>: The supported types are integer, float, and string.|This expression returns false:<br>greaterOrEquals(10,100)
|[empty](#use-the-empty-expression)|Returns true if the object, array, or string is empty.|This expression returns true:<br>empty('')
|not|Returns the opposite of a boolean value. |This expression returns true:<br>not(contains('200 Success','Fail'))
|if|Returns a specific value if the expression results in true or false.|This expression returns "yes":<br>if(equals(1, 1), 'yes', 'no')

## Prerequisites
* Access to Microsoft Flow.
* A spreadsheet with the tables described later in this walkthrough. Be sure to save your spreadsheet in a location such as Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive so that Microsoft Flow can access it.
* Microsoft Office 365 Outlook (While we use Office 365 Outlook, you can use any supported email service in your flows.)

## Use the or expression
Sometimes your workflow needs to take an action if the value of an item is valueA **or** valueB. For example, you may be tracking the status of tasks in a spreadsheet table. Assume that the table has a column named *Status* and the possible values in the *Status* column are:

* **completed**
* **blocked**
* **unnecessary**
* **not started**

Here's an example of what the spreadsheet might look like:

![sample spreadsheet](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table.png)

Given the preceding spreadsheet, you want to use Microsoft Flow to remove all rows with a *Status* column that's set to *completed* or *unnecessary*.

Let's create the flow.

### Start with a blank flow
1. Sign into [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com).

    ![sign in](includes/media/modern-approvals/sign-in.png)
2. Select the **My flows** tab.

    ![select my flows](includes/media/modern-approvals/select-my-flows.png)
3. Select **Create from blank**.

    ![create from blank](includes/media/modern-approvals/blank-template.png)

### Add a trigger to your flow
1. Search for **Schedule**, and then select the **Schedule - Recurrence** trigger

    ![schedule trigger](includes/media/schedule-trigger/schedule-trigger.png)
2. Set the schedule to run once daily.

    ![set schedule](includes/media/schedule-trigger/set-schedule.png)

### Select the spreadsheet and get all rows
1. Select **New step** > **Add an action**.

    ![new step](includes/media/new-step/action.png)
2. Search for **rows**, and then select **Excel - Get rows**.

    Note: Select the "get rows" action that corresponds to the spreadsheet that you're using. For example, if you're using Google Sheets, select **Google Sheets - Get rows**.

    ![get Rows](includes/media/new-step/get-excel-rows.png)
3. Select the folder icon in the **File name** box, browse to, and then select the spreadsheet that contains your data.

    ![select spreadsheet](includes/media/new-step/select-spreadsheet.png)
4. Select the table that contains your data from the **Table name** list.

    ![select table](includes/media/new-step/select-table.png)

### Check the status column of each row
1. Select **New step** > **More** > **Add an apply to each**.

    ![select table](includes/media/new-step/apply-to-each.png)
2. Add the **Value** token to the **Select an output from previous steps** box.

    ![select table](includes/media/apply-to-each/add-value-token.png)
3. Select **Add a condition** > **Edit in advanced mode**.
4. Add the following **or** expression. This **or** expression checks the value of each row in the table (a row is known as an item when accessed in a expression). If the value of the **status** column is *completed* **or** *unnecessary*, the **or** expression evaluates to "true".

    The **or** expression appears as shown here:

    ````@or(equals(item()?['status'], 'unnecessary'), equals(item()?['status'], 'completed'))````

    Your **Condition** card resembles this image:

    ![or expression image](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/or-expression.png)

### Delete matching rows from the spreadsheet
1. Select **Add an action** on the **IF YES, DO NOTHING** branch of the condition.
2. Search for **Delete row**, and then select **Excel - Delete row**.

    ![delete row image](includes/media/new-step/select-delete-excel-row.png)
3. In the **File name** box, search for, and select the spreadsheet file that contains the data you want to delete.
4. In the **Table name** list, select the table that contains your data.
5. Place the **Row id** token in the **Row id** box.

    ![spreadsheet file](includes/media/new-step/delete-excel-row.png)

### Name the flow and save it
1. Give your flow a name and then select the **Create flow** button.

    ![save your flow](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/name-and-save.png)

### Run the flow with the or expression
The flow runs after you save it. If you created the spreadsheet shown earlier in this walkthrough, here's how it looks like after the run completes:

![or expression completes](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table-after-or-expression-runs.png)

Notice all data from rows that had "completed" or "unnecessary" in the Status column were deleted.

## Use the and expression
Assume you have a spreadsheet table with two columns. The column names are Status and Assigned. Assume also that you want to delete all rows if the Status column's value is "blocked" and the Assigned column's value is "John Wonder".  To accomplish this task, follow all steps earlier in this walkthrough, however, when you edit the **Condition** card in advanced mode, use the **and** expression shown here:

````@and(equals(item()?['Status'], 'blocked'), equals(item()?['Assigned'], 'John Wonder'))````

Your **Condition** card resembles this image:

![and expression image](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/and-expression.png)

### Run the flow with the and expression
If you followed along, your spreadsheet resembles this image:

![before and runs](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table-before-and-expression-runs.png)

After your flow runs, your spreadsheet resembles this image:

![after and runs](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table-after-and-expression-runs.png)

## Use the empty expression
Notice that there are several empty rows in the spreadsheet now. To remove them, use the **empty** expression to identify all rows that don't have any text in the Assigned and Status columns.

To accomplish this task, follow all steps listed in **Use the and expression** section earlier in this walkthrough, however, when you edit the **Condition** card in advanced mode, use the empty expression this way:

````@and(empty(item()?['Status']), empty(item()?['Assigned']))````

Your **Condition** card resembles this image:

![empty expression image](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/empty-expression.png)

After your flow runs, the spreadsheet resembles this image:

![after empty runs](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table-after-empty-expression-runs.png)

Notice extra lines are removed from the table.

## Use the greater expression
Imagine you've bought baseball tickets for your coworkers and you're using a spreadsheet to ensure you're reimbursed by each person. You can quickly create a flow that sends a daily email to each person who hasn't paid the full amount.

Use the **greater** expression to identify the employees who haven't paid the full amount. You can then automatically send a friendly reminder email to those who haven't paid in full.

Here's a view of the spreadsheet:

![view of spreadsheet](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/tickets-spreadsheet-table.png)

Here's the implementation of the **greater** expression that identifies all persons who have paid less than the amount due from them:

````@greater(item()?['Due'], item()?['Paid'])````

## Use the less expression
Imagine you've bought baseball tickets for your coworkers, and you're using a spreadsheet to ensure you're reimbursed by each person by the date to which everyone agreed. You can create a flow that sends a reminder email to each person who hasn't paid the full amount if the current date is less than one day before the due date.

Use the **and** expression along with the **less** expression since there are two conditions being validated:


|          Condition to validate          | expression to use |                    Example                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|   Has the full amount due been paid?    |      greater      |   @greater(item()?['Due'], item()?['Paid'])    |
| Is the due date less than one day away? |       less        | @less(item()?['DueDate'], addDays(utcNow(),1)) |

## Combine the greater and less expressions in an and expression
Use the **greater** expression to identify the employees who have paid less than the full amount due and use the **less** expression to determine if the payment due date is less than one day away from the current date. You can then the **Send an email** action to send friendly reminder email to those who haven't paid in full and the due date is less than one day away.

Here's a view of the spreadsheet table:

![view of spreadsheet](./media/use-expressions-in-conditions/spreadsheet-table-due-date.png)

Here's the implementation of the **and** expression that identifies all persons who have paid less than the amount due from them and the due date is less than one day away from the current date:

````@and(greater(item()?['Due'], item()?['Paid']), less(item()?['dueDate'], addDays(utcNow(),1)))````
